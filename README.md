# Majority Wins: A Group Travel Planning App

Majority Wins will help families or friend groups decide what activities, museums, tours, landmarks, restaurants, etc. they want to see while traveling.
Users can login, submit their suggested activities, places, etc. to a form, and then once everyone has submitted their ideas, the group will login to “upvote" and "downvote” whether they’re interested in that activity, place, museum, etc. or not.
After voting, the group’s activities will be ranked and shown to the group as cards in the order of the most popular to least popular so they know what to include in their itinerary.
This app can be used to plan travel to cities (ex: Paris submissions= eiffel tower, Louvre, Restaurants, cycling tour, etc), Theme Parks (ex: Disney Rides submissions= Peter Pan, Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, It's a Small World), or even Places to Stay (ex: Airbnb or Hotel Options).

This is my Front-End Capstone for Nashville Software School, and I hope you enjoy.
